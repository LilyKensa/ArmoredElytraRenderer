# Armored Elytra Renderer

I stole it from [mrmelon45/armored_elytra](https://github.com/mrmelon54/armored_elytra)!

Wait! I know you're going to say "stealing other people's project is bad,"
but the original project won't work in 1.21 environment (and I don't know why!)

To my surprise, writing the exact same code in the environment provided by [Architectury API Generator](generate.architectury.dev/) worked `:I`

---

Let's be serious for a bit.

This project is just a very casual (?) port, and have been updated to fit Minecraft 1.21 (The super complicated Component API...) 

The goal is to render chestplate and elytra at the same time 
when using the [Armored Elytra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUivDpVDhE) 
datapack by [VaniilaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) team.

I changed the mod name just to clarify
that this is just the renderer part.

I'm not going to do anything further, as coding in Java is super painful, you know `;(`
